The goal of these labs is to implement several synchronization algorithms. For this we will use a small multi-player board game. The provided version does not manage the synchronization between players. It leads to a final state where several players have a different view on the results. You will have to implement several algorithms seen during the lessons.

Ricart and Agrawala mutual exclusion
The bakery algorithm of mutual exclusion from Lamport
The distributed synchronized lists
